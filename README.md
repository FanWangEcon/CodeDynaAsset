Exogenous incomplete borrowing and savings models. 

<!-- Each self-contained folder includes all codes required to invoke each model.

Each model folder has this file structure:

1. invoke: file that invoke, call the file in the solve folder, to loop over various parameter combinations
2. solve: the solution code for solving the model, including solution code for optimization and code for finding distributions. Generally, several versions of codes are included for solving the model using different algorithms.
3. tools: files, functions, specific to this model that helps solving things
4. params: including files that contain different parameter combinations

There is a an overall tools folder that contains codes/files that are shared across folders.

Within each subfolder, there is possibly a *_profile* folder for html files that are profiling results (only several main files are stored, so most links are not clickable), and a html file with files generated by matlab publish. -->

# the AZ model
<!-- https://fanwangecon.github.io/CodeDynaAsset/m_az -->

The standard heterogeneous agent model with assets and shocks. Endogenous asset. Income is a function of exogenous wage and endogenous interest earnings. Exogenous incomplete borrowing and savings. Wage shocks follow AR1.

## Optimization

Solving for the policy functions.

1. Solution Main: m \| html \| profile
2. Policy and Value Function Analysis:
    - post processing: m \| html
    - post graphing: m \| html
3. Support:
    - set default parameters: [m](https://fanwangecon.github.io/CodeDynaAsset/m_az/paramfunc/ffs_az_set_default_param.m) \| html(https://fanwangecon.github.io/CodeDynaAsset/m_az/paramfunc/html/ffs_az_set_default_param.html)
