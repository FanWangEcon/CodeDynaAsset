This is a work-in-progress [website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/CodeDynaAsset/) of collections of code for solving several infinite horizon exogenous incomplete dynamic asset models, produced by [Fan](https://fanwangecon.github.io/). Materials gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research).

Generally, several versions of the same code are shown with increasing code optimization. Looped versions of programs are shown for clarity. Vectorized codes are generally shown. Optimized vectorized versions of programs are also shown. The optimized code is dramatically faster than the base code. Main functions rely on support functions which are all included in the repository and some key files are shown below.

To test functions, clone the project, and run any function. Each function is written with default parameters and is directly callable. Optimized vectorized codes do not require special hardware but should be tested on computers with at least 16GB and preferably 32GB of memory. Functions below also come with HTML files generated by the Matlab publish command. Core functions come with profiling results.

Tested with [Matlab 2019a](https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsroom/mathworks-announces-release-2019a-of-matlab-and-simulink.html).

<!-- Each self-contained folder includes all codes required to invoke each model.

Each model folder has this file structure:

1. invoke: file that invoke, call the file in the solve folder, to loop over various parameter combinations
2. solve: the solution code for solving the model, including solution code for optimization and code for finding distributions. Generally, several versions of codes are included for solving the model using different algorithms.
3. tools: files, functions, specific to this model that helps solving things
4. params: including files that contain different parameter combinations

There is a an overall tools folder that contains codes/files that are shared across folders.

Within each subfolder, there is possibly a *_profile* folder for html files that are profiling results (only several main files are stored, so most links are not clickable), and a html file with files generated by matlab publish. -->

# Solving the One Asset One Shock Problem
<!-- https://fanwangecon.github.io/CodeDynaAsset/m_az -->

The standard heterogeneous agent model with assets and shocks. Endogenous asset. Income is a function of exogenous wage and endogenous interest earnings. Exogenous incomplete borrowing and savings. Wage shocks follow AR1.
