## What is the effect of minimum income on optimal choices?

Given minimum income, when aggregate savings is equal to 0 next period cash-on-hand is not zero

- COH(k=0, b=0 z) = Y_min

This means the marginal utility of aggregate savings is not infinity when w'=0. The question is, should households save at all in this situation? Without choosing any investments: MUC_t = MUC_t+1 by construction. Given the fact that we have preference for today vs future, could easily not want to save anything.


This extends beyond the lowest coh to also people with slightly higher coh, given present bias, they might want to not save. future has a discount factor in front, its MU is lower to start. This ends up been absorbing states.

However, if future minimum

As we increase Y_min, I think at the lowest lowest levels of Y_min marginal utility so high, today and tomorrow at the worst stage, the additional gainsand losses from risky investment is not worth it?

As Y_min increases, at the lowest COH_Y_min, household choose k' only.
