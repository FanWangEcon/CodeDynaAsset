# Models and Algorithms

Several models related to several [papers](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) are implemented here. For each economic model, there are often a number of computational algorithms. Algorithms compete on their ability to best approximate the underlying economic model's solutions. For each computational algorithm, there are generally also different implementations that generate identical solutions but compete on speed.

# Models in Repository

The first main model is the one dynamic asset and shocks model. The second main model is the two dynamic asset and shocks model. For each model, several algorithms are provided that offer different qualities of approximations. For each algorithm, various implementations are also shown with varying speed but identical solution approximations.

# Solution, Distribution and Equilibrium

Dynamic asset models have three broad components: 1, solution; 2, distribution; 3, equilibrium. The sections below try to cover different algorithms and implementations of algorithms to solve for optimal conditional choices, joint asset distributions, and equilibrium prices.

# Research

These algorithms here are developed in the process of trying to solve and estimate models in these [papers](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research), and might not be appropriate for alternative models.
