The benchmark simulation is for physical capital investments. Risky asset has decreasing return to Scale and depreciation.

Now simulate the risky asset as a stock, with constant return to scale, full depreciation (so only return is from asset risky return, no safe return component).

Check different levels of shock persistence.
